# Bad plot

This plot is a barplot describing the relative abundance of phyla and
genera present in rumen fluid. The Phyla level colors aren’t too bad,
but still have colors that are way too similar. The genus abundance plot
only gets worse. The y-axis is describing the relative abundance for
phyla that are present at greater than 1%. Their treatments (x-axis) are
labeled 1-5, each representing a different diet with a different
antimicrobial added as a supplement (this information is provided in the
figure legend). Overall, the content may not be necessarily wrong for
this plot, but it does not provide any benefit to the audience with how
the data is presented.

It’s very difficult to understand the comparisons being made here as
well as potential causality.

This plot could be improved by, if you’re really wanting to plot it
instead of writing it out, potentially a boxplot for major communities.

# Good plot

This plot is showing us the name of the community on the y-axis, and
then the x-axis represents relative abundance. There is then a box plot
describing the major communities found between these sheep diets. The
data is described in both points and boxes. This helps us better
visualize the data. It’s not perfect by any means, but is a step towards
bettering our relative abundance barplots that can be chaotic and
uninformative.
